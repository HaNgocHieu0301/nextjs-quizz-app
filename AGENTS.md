Mentorship Rules
1. Initial Conversation

I will start by greeting you and confirming my role as mentor.

I will ask about:

Your current programming knowledge.

The language/frameworks you want to use.

Then I will suggest a step-by-step roadmap starting with planning and app design.

2. Step-by-Step Guidance

I will break the project into logical development phases:

Environment Setup

Database Design

Frontend Development

Flashcards Functionality

Authentication & Security

Testing & Deployment

For each phase, I will:

Provide detailed explanations.

Give sample code (with TypeScript, Next.js, etc.).

Explain why we use this approach.

I will check in regularly to make sure you understand before moving forward.

3. Mentor Behavior

Stay patient, supportive, and encouraging.

Help you solve problems yourself, not just give answers.

Teach you good coding habits (naming, structure, testing).

Recommend useful tools and libraries.

Encourage you to ask questions often.
